At University of Oregon as the instructor of record I have taught advanced econometrics, labor, and development economics, managed teaching assistants and TA'ed for a variety of courses. I have been distinguished with a Graduate Teaching Award and received excellent student feedback. Below you can find course summaries, materials, and student feedback.   


## Independent Instructor  


**EC 350: Issues in Labor Economics** (Spring 2019, Spring 2020)  
[Syllabus](Etcheverry_EC350_S20_Syllabus.pdf)  
In this course, students explore issues in the labor market using insights from economic theory and empirical papers. The course starts studying labor supply and labor demand and then it examines some of the potential causes of wage inequality, such as human capital investment, compensating wage differentials, the decline of organized labor, and discrimination.   
 
 
 
**EC 421: Introduction to Econometrics (II)** (Fall 2019, Fall 2020)  
[Syllabus,](Etcheverry_EC421_F19_Syllabus.pdf) [Course materials](https://github.com/LuEtcheverry/EC421F19)  
This course prepares students for the demands of real-world applications. Toward this goal, we examine the assumptions that underly econometric and statistical models. These models impose strong assumptions that are often violated in practice. Thus, we will relax these assumptions-replacing them with looser, more palatable assumptions-and derive, build, and estimate the resulting new models. By the end of this course, students have the ability to statistically examine the bulk of economic issues using econometrics-knowing how to empirically test economic models and knowing the strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions of their chosen route of analysis. Learning statistical programming is inherent to practicing applied econometrics. Consequently, throughout this course students also learn the statistical programming language R.



**EC 490: Development Economics** (Summer 2020)  
[Syllabus](Etcheverry_EC490_Syllabus_Su20.pdf)  
This course explores the main issues affecting the well-being of individuals living in low- and middle-income countries while studying the decision-making process of these households, with a focus on health, education and finance. Students are exposed to both theoretical and empirical tools used in development as well as the tools used to critically evaluate development and poverty alleviation programs run by governments and non-governmental organizations.
While doing so, students honor their skills to critically read academic articles from empirical economics, and deepen their understanding of econometrics learning about RCT, difference-in-differences and fixed effects models among others.

## Student feedback 

*"Luciana is easily one of the strongest graduate instructors I've had at the University of Oregon. She's incredibly intelligent and genuine, and that comes across in her teaching. She communicated all information incredibly clearly and efficiently. Luciana would frequently check in with us to make sure the pacing and structure of the lab section was as effective as possible, which I really appreciated. She was also happy to answer questions about economics beyond the scope of the class (more advanced econometrics, graduate school, etc.) It's very apparent that she sincerely cares about her students and their learning. Without a doubt, I would take a class taught by Luciana again."* EC 421: Introduction to Econometrics (II) (Spring 2018)

*"Loved that everything was always organized and available online to go back and review. Material was very clear"* EC 350: Issues in Labor Economics (Spring 2019) 

*"Luciana is a great teacher that expresses her love of economics very well, even to the point where it can be contagious. Always on time, and very understanding. Would love to take a class taught by her in the future."* EC 350: Issues in Labor Economics (Spring 2019) 

*"It was really nice to connect with other hardworking Latina in this field"* Econometrics (Fall 2019)

*"Instructor showed clarity in her support for her students. Explained a complex course very thoroughly. Always available to help students succeed."* EC 421: Introduction to Econometrics (II) (Fall 2019)

*"I really enjoyed this class and appreciate how accommodating it was for us students during these crazy times. Even though it was a short summer term class I feel like I learned more than in most of the 10 week classes I have taken. Your lecture slides make the papers so much easier to understand!"* EC 490: Development Economics (Summer 2020)
