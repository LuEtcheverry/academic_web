I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Oregon. I study development, labor, and gender economics using a broad microeconometric toolkit. My research focuses on program and policy evaluation in the areas of paid family leave, early childhood development, financial inclusion and crime.

Fields of Study: Labor Economics, Development Economics, Gender Economics, and Applied Econometrics.

I am on the 2020-2021 job market and will be interviewing as part of the ASSA 2021 Virtual Conference.
